- 👋  Hi, I’m @Kubix86
- 👀  I’m interested in video games and really enjoy travelling. 
      That’s why, for the last six years, I have been working as a truck driver,
      visiting most countries in Europe.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning QA from scratch and have also enrolled in CS50 at Harvard.
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on impactful projects that make a difference in the world.
      I’m particularly interested in AI technology and how it can be used to solve complex problems
       and drive positive change.
- 📫 If you want to contact me, you can send me an email at l.kubicki@icloud.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: Sorry, I think most of us are predetermined, but if I'm wrong, it's Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Only when we meet :D
